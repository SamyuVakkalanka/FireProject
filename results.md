## Expansion and Wildfire: How WUI Growth in California Changes Fire's Interactions with Humans

California wildfires are constantly in the nation's spotlight. The media spreads jarring images of burning houses and wildland, planes dropping fire retardent on blazing forests, and smokey skies. At the end of these destructive events, affected communities rebuild and attempt to continue their lives as normal. However, as fires become more common in the changing climate and people better understand fire regimes and the land's reliance on fire as an ecological force, human impact on these fires and their interaction with them comes into question. 

### The Wild-Urban Interface

The wild-urban interface (WUI) is when human development intersects with wildlands. Often, this refers to residential zones, with houses being built into the native vegetation. There are two forms of interaction between these neighborhoods and the wildland: intermix and interface. Intermix WUI refers to when houses are built into the wildlife, with the natural fauna being integrated into the residential areas. Interface WUI is where there are clear boundaries between the residencies and the wildland (See Figure 1). Both forms of development lead to major consequences for both the humans living there and the natural landscape and native ecosystem that the construction is encroaching on. As humans disturb the wildlands, they disturb many of the ecological processes necessary to sustain the ecosystem as well as introduce non-native species and threats to the landscape. In turn, the ecology has to change, leaving the neighborhoods with an unstable and potentially unpredictable environment (Radeloff et al.).

### WUI in California

Across the United States, WUI is the "fastest growing land use type" (Radeloff et al.). In California, the WUI is one of the major zones of residential development, with 4.5 million homes in these regions as of 2017 (Schoennagel et al.). Figure 2 uses GIS data collected by the Silvis lab through the University of Wisconsin. QGIS mapped the geospatial data and created layers for each year that could then be cycled through to animate the growth of WUI zones over three decades (1990, 2000, and 2010). Significant growth of primarily intermix development occured in the Central Valley (especially near Fresno) up past Sacramento. In addition, the region above San Francisco into North California show significant growth of both interface and intermix WUI regions. Interestingly, Southern California did not seem to show much development into wildlands.

### Wildfire

One of the most observable impacts of California's unrestrained growth into wildlands is wildfire. In California, the largest percent of wildfires burned in WUI zones (35%)(Schoennagel et al.). This is especially jarring considering the increasing numbers of fires starting each year. CalFire, along with the California state government collect an abundance of data related to many of the wildfires above a minimum area. From how the fire started to the time it was reported to how many acres it burned, CalFire collects as much as information as possible and then publicly release the files with the information. These files were put into a program like ArcGIS, which mapped the fires and could be queried to create artificial layers for each decade of interest. Figures 3-5 shows these maps for each of the decades where WUI data was mapped.
